<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# About App

## About authentication using AUTH.JS

1. The auth.js at the root of the directory contains the functions/functionalities provided by Auth JS lib
2. the functions used are signin, signout, handlers(for handling http requests such as GET and POST), and auth(contains session information/metadata such as username)
3. The auth, signIn, signOut functions are added as the action to be performed on login page in the the sepcific (personally created {learned abot in another video}) file `lib/actions/auth.js`
4. The handlers function is used in `app\api\auth\[...nextauth]\route.js` file
5. The route.js file handles all the requests to /api/auth/* (meaning all the requests for authentications)
Note:  The [...nextauth] part is a dynamic API route. In Next.js, square brackets ([...]) denote a catch-all route parameter
